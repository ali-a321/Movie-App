# Movie-App

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses asynchronous functions to handle API requests and DOM manipulation for an interactive user experience. The site retrieves and displays information about movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It allows users to view a list of the latest popular movies initially and provides a search functionality to look up specific movies. It dynamically creates an interface with movie posters, titles, and ratings. When a movie poster is clicked, a popup displays detailed information about the selected movie, including its overview and release date.
